## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media Query

### What I learned

I learnt the how a responsive site works by varying the viewport size. Along with this I learnt using images as an asset and using color gradient on top of it. Apart from this, I learnt the basics of Flex-Box.

### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me in case of flex box properties and their values for aligning the content.
- [Stack Overflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com) - This helped as I could visit the solutions to similar doubts I had during the project.
